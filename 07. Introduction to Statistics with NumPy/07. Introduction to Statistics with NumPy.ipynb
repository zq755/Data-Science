    "- Arrays are a special type of list that allows us to store values in an organized manner.\n",
    "- An array can be created by either defining it directly using __np.array()__ or by importing a CSV using __np.genfromtxt('file.csv', delimiter=',')__.\n",
    "- An operation (such as addition) can be performed on every element in an array by simply performing it on the array itself.\n",
    "- Elements can be selected from arrays using their index and array locations, both of which start at 0.\n",
    "- Logical operations can be used to create new, more focused arrays out of larger arrays."
